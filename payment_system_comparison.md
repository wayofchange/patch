I personally don't like Paypal as it was nigh-impossible to get my money out when my card number/phone number was different than registration. Annoying, but this is anecdotal. 

After reading it seems that Stripe probably fits our use case the best. They have a [form](https://stripe.com/en-ca/use-cases/crypto#request-invite) where you can ask them about particular services' availability per region.
