# Patch
Patch is a permissionless, encryption-focused file storage/sharing/transferring, social media and messaging app which gives users back the keys to drive their data.

- ## Why we advocate for privacy:

    The internet of today has taken significant power away from people. The services we use daily exist to track, store, and sell every piece of data we save, share or send. Laws exist within postal systems, like the [USPS](https://about.usps.com/handbooks/as353/as353c2_004.htm) (US), or [FOIP](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/page-1.html#h-397177) (Canada) which essentially state that a "Federal Body" must divulge any/all details kept/trafficked about an individual to them.  Legislation tells companies that they can't release this information without the individual's consent. 
    
    Yet, privacy laws which apply to national agencies have no reach on the big players in the communications industry. The corporate groups that administer and control the flow of information operate almost entirely outside of established guidelines which were created to protect individuals' private information. For most people today, there is zero expectation of privacy online.
    
    Many accept this situation for several reasons. Some do because they feel they have nothing to hide, or the belief that only criminals need privacy. But this couldn't be further from the truth. Confidentiality is paramount for essential services like medicine, law, finance, and others. Besides its importance to the integrity of confidential records, privacy is inherently valuable to our inner psychology. This topic which has been studied and published on extensively, like in [Privacy and Human Behavior In the Age of Information, Acquisti, Brandimarte, Loewenstein](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/papers/Acquisti-Science-Privacy-Review.pdf), or in [PRIVACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS
An International Survey of Privacy Laws and Practice, Banisar](https://gilc.org/privacy/survey/intro.html) and many others.  Article 12 of [the UN's Charter Of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) also stipulates that,

    > "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with [their] privacy, family, home or correspondence..."
    
    Many people see no alternative to centralized methods of data access. Services offered by companies like Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook/Instagram), Microsoft (Skype/GitHub/LinkedIn) are accessible and convenient in many ways. It can be easy to overlook the true cost we've incurred by supporting the model these companies employ. These companies promote a model whereby people trade the use of "free" services for their personal info. However, people don't necessarily "like"üëç this arrangement. 
    
    Patch is here to offer an alternative to secure your data from all third parties - including our own team. We will continue to implement the best [quantum-resistent encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography) algorithms available to keep your data safe & in an age that could see the arrival of the world's first true quantum computer.
