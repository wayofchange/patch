## Pitches

- ### For the privacy advocate:

    The internet of today has taken the power away from the people, when it comes to our data. The services we use daily track, store, and sell every peice of data we save, share or send. Laws exist within postal systems, like the [USPS](https://about.usps.com/handbooks/as353/as353c2_004.htm) (US), or [FOIP](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/page-1.html#h-397177) (Canada) which essentially state that a "Federal Body" must divulge any/all details kept/trafficked about an individual to them, and that they can't release this information without the individual's consent. 
    
    Yet, privacy laws which apply to national agencies have no reach on the big players in the communications industry. The corporate groups that administer and control the flow of information operate almost-entirely outside of established guidelines, which were created to protect individuals' private information. For most people today there is zero expectation of privacy online.
    
    Some have accepted this situation for several reasons. Some do because they feel they have nothing to hide, or that only criminals need privacy. But this couldn't be further from the truth. Confidentiality is paramount for essential services like medicine, law, finance, and others. Besides its importance to the integrity of confidential records, privacy is inherently valuable to our inner psychology. A topic which has been written about extensively, like in [Privacy and Human Behavior In the Age of Information, Acquisti, Brandimarte, Loewenstein](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/papers/Acquisti-Science-Privacy-Review.pdf), or in [PRIVACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS
An International Survey of Privacy Laws and Practice, Banisar](https://gilc.org/privacy/survey/intro.html) and many others.  Article 12 of [the UN's Charter Of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) also stipulates that,

    > "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with [their] privacy, family, home or correspondence..."
    
    Many people see no alternative to centralized methods of data access. Services offered by companies like Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook/Instagram), Microsoft (Skype/GitHub/LinkedIn) are accessible and convenient in many ways. It can be easy to overlook the true cost we've incurred by supporting the model these companies employ. It's a concept whereby people trade the use of "free" services for their personal info. However, people don't necessarily "like"üëç this arrangement. 
    
    Patch is here to offer an alternative, that secures your data from all third parties, including our own team. We realize that quantum computing is on the near horizon, and implement [quantum-resistent encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography) algorithms to keep your data safe, even into the era of quantum-computing.
