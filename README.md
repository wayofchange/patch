## Pitches

- ### For the privacy advocate:

    The internet of today has taken the power away from the people, when it comes to our data. The services we use daily track, store, and sell every peice of data we save, share or send. Laws exist within postal systems, like the [USPS](https://about.usps.com/handbooks/as353/as353c2_004.htm) (US), or [FOIP](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/page-1.html#h-397177) (Canada) which essentially state that a "Federal Body" must divulge any/all details kept/trafficked about an individual to them, and that they can't release this information without the individual's consent. 
    
    Yet, privacy laws which apply to national agencies have no reach on the big players in the communications industry. The corporate groups that administer and control the flow of information operate almost-entirely outside of established guidelines, which were created to protect individuals' private information.
